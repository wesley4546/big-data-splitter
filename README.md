# Welcome to the home of the big-data-splitter

As we go on our journey of programming, data science, data engineering, and many other lovely things we are sometimes faced with HUGE data!

Do you have a JSON file that is 166 GB and want to break it down into smaller more manageable JSON files? (Thats literally the inspiration behind me!)

I can also tackle other problems too!

## Requirement
I only have one request...You have to put the `big-data-splitter.py` in the same directory as your HUGE data file (A sacrafice we have to make). 

You can literally copy and paste me! 

Just make sure that I'm the newest version.

## Examples
Here are some example code answers to the questions I'm going to ask!

```
What file are we splitting today? (Please add the file extension): HUGE-data.json

What's the base name of our new files? tweets

What extension should I be making the new files? (example: .json): .json

How many new files would you like to create in total? 5

How many lines do you want each file to be of the file_to_split? 50
```

Don't worry, I'll update you on my progress as we tackle this problem together. 
This is what that'll look like:








Happy big-data-splitting!
